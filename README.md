Currently an AI Chatbot to chat with any characters you wish to :o

currently a boring chatbot that ask who are you and who do you want to chat with
and then the chat will keep looping until you say stop to end the chat

however, the funny part is that even with loop, the chatbot will not remember the previous chat

currently working on:
- User experience
- Chatbot memory
- GUI? (unlikely, because I am bad at GUI)

This README.md is temporary boring, please allow me to update this README.md later when I have time to do so
